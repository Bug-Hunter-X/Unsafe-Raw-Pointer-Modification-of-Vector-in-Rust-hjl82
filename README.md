# Unsafe Raw Pointer Modification of Vector in Rust

This repository demonstrates an example of unsafe code in Rust that modifies a vector using a raw pointer.  This showcases potential risks associated with raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows the unsafe code. The solution (`bugSolution.rs`) offers a safer way to achieve the desired modification.
